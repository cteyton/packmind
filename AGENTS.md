Welcome to Promyze!
Promyze is very fresh app to manage coding practices.

# Structure
* apps/front: contains the code of the frontend Packmind app
* apps/backend: expose API endpoints

# Commands

- npm run test: run the test suite
- npm run dev:legacy to start the server in dev environments

# Data persistence

Promyze is using MongoDB as storage for Data and Mongoose are ORMs
 
# Issues Management

- Issues are defined and tracked in the **Packmind MonoRepo GitHub Project** (Project #2)
- All development work should reference the appropriate GitHub issue number when applicable
- Issues follow a structured workflow: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → To review → Done

## GitHub MCP Issue Operations

The GitHub MCP provides tools to interact with issues programmatically:

### List Issues
```typescript
mcp_github_list_issues({
  owner: "PackmindHub",
  repo: "packmind-monorepo",
  state: "OPEN",        // "OPEN", "CLOSED", or omit for all
  perPage: 50           // Number of results per page
})
```

### Get Specific Issue
```typescript
mcp_github_get_issue({
  owner: "PackmindHub",
  repo: "packmind-monorepo", 
  issue_number: 197     // The issue number (not ID)
})
```

### Add Comment to Issue
```typescript
mcp_github_add_issue_comment({
  owner: "PackmindHub",
  repo: "packmind-monorepo",
  issue_number: 197,
  body: "## Your comment content\n\nMarkdown is supported for formatting."
})
```

**Note**: Use these tools to track progress, document decisions, and communicate with the team directly through GitHub issues.

# Task splitting

- For any task you perform, you MUST split it into multiple into sub-tasks which have a logical increment (eg: new endpoint, new component, new use case etc). When a task is done, run all the validation steps (lint, test, packmind etc) and ask me for validation of the work you did.
- Each sub task MUST have its own commit.
- Before commiting anything, you must ensure that `npm run quality-gate` does not raise any issue.

# Commiting

- When referencing an issue (example #123), DO NOT write "Close" or "Fix", as this closes the issue which has not been validated by other developers.
- Before proposing to commit, ALWAYS run `npm run quality-gate` and fix the issues found
- NEVER use the `--no-verify` argument when commiting
- After commiting, ALWAYS ensure that the commit was successful.

# Packmind Standards

Before starting your work, make sure to review the coding standards relevant to your current task.

Always consult the sections that apply to the technology, framework, or type of contribution you are working on.

All rules and guidelines defined in these standards are mandatory and must be followed consistently.

Failure to follow these standards may lead to inconsistencies, errors, or rework. Treat them as the source of truth for how code should be written, structured, and maintained.

## Standard: Changelog

Maintain CHANGELOG.MD using Keep a Changelog format with a top [Unreleased] section linked to HEAD, ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD), and per-release comparison links like [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z to ensure accurate, consistent release documentation and version links. :
* Ensure all released versions have their corresponding comparison links defined at the bottom of the CHANGELOG.MD file in the format [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z
* Format all release dates using the ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-11-21) to ensure consistent and internationally recognized date representation
* Maintain an [Unreleased] section at the top of the changelog with its corresponding link at the bottom pointing to HEAD to track ongoing changes between releases

Full standard is available here for further request: [Changelog](.packmind/standards/changelog.md)

## Standard: Testing good practices

Standardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :
* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern
* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks
* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels
* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'
* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach
